Getting Started
===============

``FlowCal`` requires the Python programming language, version 2.7 . We recommend most Windows and OS X users to :doc:`download and install Anaconda<install_anaconda>`, a Python distribution that already includes commonly used Python packages, many of which are used by ``FlowCal``. OSX already includes its own version of Python, but it does not include some Python tools that ``FlowCal`` requires. Therefore, Anaconda is recommended.

People that have an existing python installation and are comfortable with command-line interfaces can :doc:`install FlowCal in their environment<install_python>`.
