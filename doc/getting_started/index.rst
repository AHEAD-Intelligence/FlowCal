Getting Started
===============

``FlowCal`` requires the Python programming language. We recommend most Windows and macOS users to :doc:`install FlowCal with Anaconda<install_anaconda>`, a Python distribution that already includes many necessary Python packages. macOS already includes its own version of Python, but it does not include some Python tools that ``FlowCal`` requires. Therefore, Anaconda is recommended.

Users who have an existing python installation and are comfortable with command-line interfaces can :doc:`install FlowCal in their existing environment<install_python>`.
