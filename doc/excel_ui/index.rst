FlowCal's Excel UI
==================

``FlowCal``'s Excel UI allows for easy processing of data from a set of FCS files without having to write any code. The user prepares an :doc:`input Excel file <input_format>` listing the samples to be analyzed, along with some processing options. If conversion to calibrated MEF units is desired, the user also enters information about calibration beads samples. ``FlowCal`` then reads this file and process all the samples specified therein. Processing includes density-gating to automatically eliminate events due to non-biological debris, and analysis of calibration beads to calibrate cell fluorescence to MEF. Finally, :doc:`an Excel file<outputs>` is generated by FlowCal, which contains statistics and histograms for each one of the samples specified. In addition, :doc:`plots<outputs>` for each sample are produced.
