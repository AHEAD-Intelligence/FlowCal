Request Features
================

The official way to request features is through the issue tracker on github (https://github.com/taborlab/FlowCal/issues). Try to be as descriptive as possible about the desired feature.

If you are interested in writing the code necessary to implement your feature, please visit :doc:`How to Contribute</contribute>` first.
